# How much does the electoral college advantage republicans?

The impression exists that republicans are given an unfair advantage by the
electoral college. The assumption seems intuitive given the notorious cases of
2000 and 2016. However, upon closer inspection this belief doesn't hold up. If
we compare the electoral college votes each republican candidate actually
received with what they would have gotten if votes were proportional to the
popular vote we can see that the number of elections in which they receive less than
expected is roughly equal to the number of elections in which they receive more.

This is neither in support nor in opposition to the electoral college but simply
as to dispel the notion that republicans are unfairly advantaged by it.

I analyzed the elections from 1964 to 2016 and this data can be found under the
historic/ folder.

The files contained there have the following format:

The first line contains the candidates in the form of

candidate1,party1,candidate2,party2,...

The rest of the lines will contain data for each state in the form of

name,electoral votes,votes for candidate1,percentage of vote for candidate1,electoral votes for candidate 1,votes for candidate2,...

The final line will be in the same format but containing the nation wide results.
